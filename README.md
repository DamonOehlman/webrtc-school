# webrtc-school

This is a hands-on introduction to working with WebRTC. I've often described WebRTC as an "iceberg-like" technology, whereby most of the stuff that is interesting is on the surface, but there is heaps of stuff deeper down that you may want to explore at some stage.  This browser-based workshopper, starts not necessarily with the basics but with some higher level packages such as those included in [rtc.io](http://rtc.io) and also [SimplePeer](https://github.com/feross/simple-peer) which help get you creating P2P connections quickly.  Then we'll start to dive deeper into what makes WebRTC tick, and provide more information on some of the working parts.
